  "“Optimism is the one quality more associated with success and happiness than any other.”",
  `I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control
    “I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.”`,
  `“Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.”`,
  `“Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.”`,
  `William W. Purkey
    “You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
    Love like you'll never be hurt,
    Sing like there's nobody listening,
    And live like it's heaven on earth.”`,
  `“You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.”`,

  `“Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”`,
  `“I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.”`,
  `“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”`,

    Not all those who wander are lost;
    The old that is strong does not wither,
    Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

    A light from the shadows shall spring;
    Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
    The crownless again shall be king.”`,

  `“Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.”`,
  `“Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.”`,
  `“The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.”`,
  `“I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.”`,
  `“I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.”`,

  `“Love all, trust a few,

    Under thy own life's key: be check'd for silence,
    But never tax'd for speech.”`,

And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...”``“There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment.”",
  `“If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.”`,
  `“Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.”`,
  `“Anyone who thinks sitting in church can make you a Christian must also think that sitting in a garage can make you a car.”`,

  `“You may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before she may love again. But if she loves you now, what else matters? She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.”`,
